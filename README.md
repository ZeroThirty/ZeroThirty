- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZeroThirty
- I am an old school programmer, whose carreer was directed to sales and marketing on IT, and many other areas as an entrepeneur and consultant.
- Now, rich and (never in fact) retired, I wish to have fun again coding (I was pretty good on the old days).
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code... again
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I´m not quite sure. Help me to find my way. Tks
- 📫 How to reach me zero0b1110@gmail.com
